# Model and ObservatioN Evaluation Toolkit (MONET) Input Output (IO)

**MONETIO** is an open source project and Python package that aims to create a
common platform for atmospheric composition data for weather and
air quality models.

MONET was developed to evaluate the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ)
for the NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC modeling system.
After MONET version 2.1.4, MONETIO was broken off from MONET to be its own dedicated repository [^monetio-split].
MONETIO is built to work in unison with MONET. For more information on MONET please refer to
<https://monet-arl.readthedocs.io>.

Our goal is to provide easy tools to retrieve and read atmospheric composition data in
order to speed scientific research. Currently, MONETIO is able to process
several models and observations related to air composition and meteorology.

If you use MONETIO please reference the package.

## What's New

MONETIO v0.2.7 has been released. MONETIO provides a consistent interface for reading and processing various atmospheric composition datasets through a unified reader architecture.
